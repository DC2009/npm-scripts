Moving from Gulp to npm scripts

After reading a couple of articles about npm scripts, I built my own package.json according to my current project needs.
I consider this file a work-in-progress as it will change as I will have to adapt to new needs.
Anyway it's a good starting point and is successfully replacing my Gulp configuration.

I use Pug, Stylus and ES2015.
